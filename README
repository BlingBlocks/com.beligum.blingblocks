We've built Bling Blocks on the excellent
Play! Framework (http://www.playframework.com),
but made some configuration decisions to make our
Play-projects more manageble (independent sub-projects).
Because of this, it's not always clear from the start
how to set-up and run Bling Blocks from source.

Here's a quick HOWTO, based on this release:
http://dl.beligum.com/releases/blingblocks/blingblocks-cms_0.1.0.zip

So instead of checking out the source code,
you may want to start out with the code in that zip.
You can always also checkout the project-sources from GitHub,
but make sure you keep the same structure.
For more info, please contact us.

(these instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OSX)

0) I'll assume that the 'play-2.1.1' command points to a play-2.1.1 binary,
   adapt the path if necessary (see http://www.playframework.com for details)
1) To start, make sure you're in the same folder as this file,
   then execute the following commands from your terminal:
2) cd com.beligum.core.play
3) play-2.1.1 compile
4) cd ../com.beligum.cms
5) play-2.1.1 compile
6) cd ../com.beligum.blingblocks
7) play-2.1.1 compile

If all went well, try to boot the server on localhost:

8) play-2.1.1 run

Now open your browser and surf to http://localhost:9000,
you should see the Bling Blocks website. To play around,
login at http://localhost:9000/login with demo:demo
(that is, username=demo, password=demo).

Good luck and drop us a line if you're in trouble or want to help out!
